                <h2 class="text-black  fw-bold fs-4 mt-lg-0 mt-3">The Legends Ranking Top 10 Legendary batters, powered by Wisden</h2>
                
                <p>
					It is rightly said cricket is not a game; it is an emotion. And this emotion means the world to cricket fans. Be it live extravaganza or adrenaline-pumping match highlights; fans just can never get enough of the thrill and excitement of the game. While some might applaud the batters, others are impressed by the bowling attack. Regardless of who your favorite player is, when any cricketer retires, it feels like the end of the era. And this is why, whenever your favorite player makes a comeback in domestic or league matches, it is a moment of utmost joy and enthralment for their fans. And it is precisely this emotion that the Legends Ranking zeroes in. 
<br>
<br>
Since the conclusion of the Legends League Cricket, it has become rather noticeable that even post-retirement, cricket players have a lot of games left within them. Moreover, the fans love to watch their favorite players on screens, hitting those massive numbers, masquerading with their balls to take those wickets. And that is what commenced the stardom around Legends Ranking. 
                </p>
    
               <h2 class="text-black  fw-bold fs-4 mt-lg-0 mt-3">What is Legends Ranking?</h2>
               <p>
				The Legends Ranking system is designed to accurately gauge the ranking of the world's retired players and teams. Like the ICC Ranking system focussed on rating the active players of the cricketing arenas, these rankings concentrate on the retired international players who still have a lot of sport left in them and are seen playing their master strokes in various leagues and tournaments. Legends Ranking currently works across the T20 format and is released for retired cricketing legends. 
			   </p>

			   <h2 class="text-black  fw-bold fs-4 mt-lg-0 mt-3">What is the Legends Ranking system?</h2>
			   <p>If we were to ask you you're most disheartening moment, it would surely be when you had to listen to that speech or read a post of your favorite cricket player where they announced their retirement from different cricket formats. While you all love to celebrate and keep the gameplay of the legendary cricket players alive, several of them commence playing the second stint of their career with domestic and league cricket. And this is precisely what Legends Ranking system is all about.
				<br>
				<br>
In all its forms, Legends Ranking inspires retired cricket legends to keep going and look forward to something else than international cricket. And for retired celebrated players who feel domestic and league cricket is not worth it, it showcases the real power of this cricket format to them, how into their fans are, and how much they adore watching their favorite players play in the stadiums again. Banking on the adage, A legend always remains a legend," this ranking system allocates positions on the charts to all the retired cricket players who still care about their fans, want to display their game, and never miss a moment to get and stay on top. 
<br>
<br>
Depending on the camaraderie of the retired players and the legends who still make it up in the stadiums, the Legends Ranking will note their performance in the game and the league compared with the opponent, and the overall score will be raised, and rank them accordingly. The best part - Legends Ranking provides cricket fans with the opportunity to witness the massive skills of their favorite players and see them rise through the charts even if they have retired from international cricket.
