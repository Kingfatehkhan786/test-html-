                <h2 class="text-black  fw-bold fs-4 mt-lg-0 mt-3">The Legends Ranking Top 10 Legendary batters, powered by Wisden</h2>
                
                <p>
                    For cricketing fans, there is no end to the satisfaction they earn watching the replay of their favorite match moments. It won't be wrong to say they can spend hours on a stretch watching previous match highlights with the same gusto and enthusiasm as a live match. And when these highlights concern their favorite retired cricket players, it becomes even more refreshing. However, now game enthusiasts don't only have to suffice their love for cricket with memorable shots, big hits, and marvelous strikes. They have another ranking to follow and more matches to watch that too of their favorite retired cricketing legends, with Legends Ranking. 
<br>
<br>
This new ranking system is wholly devoted to the retired players of cricket and tracks their performance in comparison with the overall team and opponent to decipher their world ranking. Although this ranking is similar to the ICC Cricket Ranking, the only difference is its focus on retired cricket players than active ones. For its excellent format, the Legends Ranking has earned quite a reputation and stardom for itself, especially with the display of fantastic gameplay by some of the most celebrated cricketing legendaries in the recently concluded Legends League Cricket T20 (LLC20). The Legends Ranking system empowers retired cricket players to stay at the top of the charts even after retirement from all formats of international cricket. And this aspiration is what blesses cricket fans with yet more fantastic game moments and memories of their favorite cricket players. 

                </p>
    
               <h2 class="text-black  fw-bold fs-4 mt-lg-0 mt-3">The Legends Ranking system and how it functions</h2>
               <p>
				The Legends Ranking powered by Wisden is a table where international cricket legends' performances are ranked using a points-based system which is worked out by doing a series of calculations leading to a more concrete moving average. Players are rated on a scale depending on how many leagues they play, the overall performance of their team, and that of the opponent. If a player's performance is better than his past record, the points increase, and the rank improves; if their performance declines, their points and rank will go down. 
				<br><br>
The score of each player's performance within a match is calculated via an algorithm that involves a series of calculations based on different match circumstances. As this calculation is entirely automated and does not involve any human indulgence, no subjective assessment is concluded. All in all, the Legends Ranking depends on the player's performance since his retirement in any national and international league. 
<br><br>
And with that, we give you the top 10 legendary batters in the world, from Kevin Pietersen to Sachin Tendulkar.
