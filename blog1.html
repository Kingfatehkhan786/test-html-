                <h2 class="text-black  fw-bold fs-4 mt-lg-0 mt-3">EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT LEGENDS RANKING & ITS POINT SYSTEM</h2>
                
                <p>
                    If there is anything more adrenaline-pumping and spell-bounding than the final tensed overs between your home team and the opponent, it has to be the world rankings of your favorite players. And this ranking becomes even more fascinating when it talks about the retired cricketing legends. Before you scratch your head contemplating if such a ranking system exists, it sure does now, with Legends Ranking. Up until now, top cricket websites have devoted all their energies to ranking the active global players of the cricket stadiums. However, now with Legends Ranking, the fanatics of the game would have another points table to look up to and follow. This post will enlighten you about the Legends Ranking, the players that make up this chart, and what it means in the cricketing arenas.
                </p>
    
               <h2 class="text-black  fw-bold fs-4 mt-lg-0 mt-3"> What is Legends Ranking?</h2>
               <p>Just like all the worldly questions, we'll start with what the Legends Ranking system is. 
                <br><br>
    The Legends Ranking system is a method designed to accurately gauge the world's retired players and teams. Unlike the ICC Ranking system, these rankings don't concentrate on the active players of the game; rather, the retired international players who still have a lot of sport left in them and are seen playing their master strokes in various leagues and tournaments. Legends Ranking currently works across the T20 format and is released for retired cricketing legends. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-black  fw-bold fs-4 mt-lg-0 mt-3">Rankings are not the same as Ratings. </h2>
    <p>A noteworthy aspect over here is not to confuse Legends Ranking as ratings. Often, people use these two words interchangeably. And when it comes to cricket rankings, the two words "rating" and "ranking" are not the same. 
        <br><br>
    <em>The ranking is attained by arranging players in descending order based on the ratings they have achieved. It denotes the position of a player on the table. On the other hand, a rating is awarded to a player based on their performance during a match. It involves complex calculations and contributes immensely to the player’s overall ranking. 
    </em>
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-black  fw-bold fs-4 mt-lg-0 mt-3">What is the Legends Ranking system?</h2>
    <p>Undeniably, the most disheartening emotion for a game enthusiast is when their favorite players announce their retirement from cricket formats. However, even post their retirement, fans never hesitate to celebrate their camaraderie, their skills, and all those fantastic moments they've bestowed them with throughout their careers. And Legends Ranking system is all about this emotion. 
        <br><br>
    The Legends Ranking is a ranking system that keeps alive the extravaganza of all the famous retired international cricket players who still are a part of several leagues, matches, and tournaments. This system is fully dedicated to the globally acclaimed but retired cricket players because "A legend always remains a legend." 
    <br><br>
    So, when your favorite players don't shy away from displaying absolute sportsmanship in world stadiums even after they retire, this ranking system will empower them to be on top of the charts again and provide something to look up to. Depending on the camaraderie of the retired players and the legends who still make it up in the stadiums, the Legends Ranking will take note of their performance in the game and the league in comparison with the opponent, and the overall score will be raised, and rank them accordingly. The best part - Legends Ranking provides cricket fans with the opportunity to witness the massive skills of their favorite players and see them rise through the charts even if they have retired from international cricket. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-black  fw-bold fs-4 mt-lg-0 mt-3">What is the aim of the Legends Ranking system?</h2>
    <p>This ranking system for retired cricket players focuses on their empowerment and enrichment by documenting their big hits, run rates, and numbers across leagues and tournaments and provides them intending to strive for the top of the charts. When our legendary players find the zeal to play leagues for their fans, the Legends Ranking will take note of their performance, rate them, and position them on the chart. 
        <br><br>
    For the retired international cricket players who are not involved with any league or competition, this ranking system would serve as a morale booster to push them outside their comfort zone and commence the next phase of their journey, post-retirement. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-black  fw-bold fs-4 mt-lg-0 mt-3">With that, Legends Ranking serves two primary purposes:</h2>
    <p>●	Rank the retired cricketing legends who still grace the stadiums with their excellent gameplay<br>
    ●	Encourage retired players to get involved with leagues and tournaments for the sake of their fans because we know there is a lot of game left in them. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-black  fw-bold fs-4 mt-lg-0 mt-3">The Legends Ranking scoring system </h2>
    <p>The Legends Ranking system is a cumulative score based on the overall performance of a retired player in T20 tournaments. The ranking of each former player depends on the overall match score and the number of wickets taken for each match. Other attributes considered include the strike rate and average of a player, along with the opponent's performance and their team's overall performance throughout the tournament. As long as the legendary players, their rankings would keep improving, ultimately occupying the top of the ranking system. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-black  fw-bold fs-4 mt-lg-0 mt-3">How authentic is the Legends Ranking system?</h2>
    <p>Legends Ranking aspires to be considered one of the most authenticated and validated ranking systems for retired cricketing legends. Although several cricket websites dedicate their ranking systems to the young and athletic players of the cricketing world, Legends Ranking is the only ranking system focused on ranking retired international cricket players. 
    <br><br>
    Currently, the Legends Ranking team focuses on boosting the knowledge about this ranking system and building its stature as an unbiased, authentic, and trustworthy system for global audiences.
